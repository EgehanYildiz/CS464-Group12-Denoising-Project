CIFAR-10 Data Information

Dataset:
- CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

Preprocessing:
- The images are normalized to the range [0,1] by dividing pixel values by 255.
- Gaussian noise is added to create noisy-clean image pairs for denoising.

Noise Parameters:
- Type: Gaussian (Normal) noise
- Mean: 0.0
- Standard Deviation (Ïƒ): 0.1

Files:
- cifar10_train.npz: Clean training data downloaded from CIFAR-10.
- cifar10_test.npz: Clean test data downloaded from CIFAR-10.
- cifar10_train_noisy.npz: Contains 'x_train_clean', 'x_train_noisy', and 'y_train'.
- cifar10_test_noisy.npz: Contains 'x_test_clean', 'x_test_noisy', and 'y_test'.

Usage:
- These files are used to train denoising models (e.g., convolutional autoencoders).
- Noisy images (x_train_noisy, x_test_noisy) serve as inputs.
- Clean images (x_train_clean, x_test_clean) are the target outputs.
